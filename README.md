# composite
Image Composites as an input to Land Cover Classification

# hypothesis

- The cloud will offer efficiencies and opportunities to accelerate science
- lcmap will be ported and likely re-engineered in the cloud
- Adhoc science R&D should start getting ready for these paradigm shifting events

# approach

- Play with Landsat-pds data
- speculate on tiling and scaling approaches for composites, NLCD and 
- monitor cloud based assets in COGs as they onfold - track Albers scenes and Tiles
- Play with Sentinel-2 COGS in AWS Public Data Registry
- Be aware of HLS and the decisions made on projections and gridding
    - UTM
    - MGRS
